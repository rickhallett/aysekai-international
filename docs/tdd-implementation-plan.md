# TDD Implementation Plan for Code Review Fixes

**Created**: January 12, 2025  
**Purpose**: Systematic Test-Driven Development approach to address all code review findings

## Overview

This plan implements all critical fixes identified in the code review using a strict TDD methodology. Each feature is developed on its own branch, tested independently, and merged via automated PR approval.

## TDD Workflow

### 1. Branch Strategy
- **Naming**: `feature/<phase>-<task-name>`
- **Base**: Always branch from `main`
- **Scope**: One feature per branch

### 2. Development Process
1. **RED**: Write failing tests that define expected behavior
2. **GREEN**: Write minimum code to make tests pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### 3. Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Code coverage must increase or maintain
- Type checking with `mypy` must pass
- Linting with `ruff` must pass
- Security scan must pass

### 4. Commit Convention
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types: feat, fix, test, refactor, docs, chore

### 5. PR Template
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes

## Tests
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated
- [ ] All tests passing

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project style

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Security (Week 1)
Focus on eliminating security vulnerabilities:
- Configuration management with Pydantic
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session logging
- Remove hardcoded paths
- Basic error handling

### Phase 2: Architecture (Week 2)
Restructure for maintainability:
- Proper package structure
- Dependency injection
- Global error boundaries
- Structured logging
- Fix circular dependencies

### Phase 3: Testing & Quality (Week 3)
Achieve comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for all modules
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end tests
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- 85% coverage target

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 4)
Production readiness:
- Caching layer implementation
- Lazy loading optimization
- Docker containerization
- Monitoring setup
- Deployment documentation

## Spec File Template

Each task specification follows this structure:

```markdown
# Task: [Task Name]

## Feature Branch
`feature/[phase]-[task-name]`

## 1. Tests (RED Phase)
```python
# tests/test_[module].py
def test_[feature]_[behavior]():
    """Test that [expected behavior]"""
    # Arrange
    # Act
    # Assert - This should fail initially
```

## 2. Implementation (GREEN Phase)
```python
# src/aysekai/[module].py
# Minimal implementation to pass tests
```

## 3. Verification (REFACTOR Phase)
```bash
# Run tests
pytest tests/test_[module].py -v

# Check types
mypy src/aysekai/[module].py

# Lint code
ruff check src/aysekai/[module].py

# Check coverage
pytest --cov=aysekai.[module] --cov-report=term-missing
```

## 4. Commit & PR
```bash
# Stage changes
git add -A

# Commit with conventional message
git commit -m "feat([scope]): implement [feature]

- Add [specific change 1]
- Add [specific change 2]
- Update tests for [feature]

Closes #[issue-number]"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/[phase]-[task-name]
gh pr create --title "[Phase X] [Feature Name]" --body "[PR template]"
```
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Security**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities
2. **Testing**: 85%+ code coverage
3. **Quality**: All code passes mypy and ruff
4. **Performance**: <100ms response times
5. **Documentation**: 100% public API documented

## Automation

Each PR will trigger:
1. Test suite execution
2. Coverage report generation
3. Security vulnerability scan
4. Type checking
5. Linting
6. Auto-merge if all checks pass

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1 (Security)
- **Week 2**: Complete Phase 2 (Architecture)
- **Week 3**: Complete Phase 3 (Testing)
- **Week 4**: Complete Phase 4 (Deployment)

Total: 4 weeks to production readiness
